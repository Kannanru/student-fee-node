# Class-Based Real-time Dashboard - Quick Start Guide

## ⚡ Quick Testing Steps

### 1. Start Backend Server
```powershell
cd c:\Attendance\MGC\backend
npm start
```
**Expected**: Server running on `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Start Frontend Server
```powershell
cd c:\Attendance\MGC\frontend
ng serve
```
**Expected**: Angular app running on `http://localhost:4200`

### 3. Login as Admin
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/login`
2. **Email**: `admin@mgdc.edu` (or check seeded admin credentials)
3. **Password**: `Admin@123`
4. Click **Login**

### 4. Navigate to Real-time Dashboard
1. Click on **"Real-time Attendance"** or **"Dashboard"** in sidebar
2. URL: `http://localhost:4200/attendance/realtime-dashboard`

### 5. Select a Class
1. **Program**: Select "BDS"
2. **Year**: Select "1"
3. **Section**: Leave as "A" (default)
4. Click **"Load Class"** button

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Student list appears with ~13 students
- ✅ All students show status: "Pending" (gray chip)
- ✅ Statistics: Total=13, Present=0, Absent=0, Pending=13
- ✅ If current session exists, session card shows subject/hall/time
- ✅ If no session, warning appears: "No active session found"

### 6. Test Real-time Status Update

Open a **new PowerShell terminal** and generate a test event:

```powershell
# Generate ENTRY event for BDS student
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/camera/test-events" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"eventType":"ENTRY_ONLY","studentId":"BDS2024001"}'
```

**Expected in Dashboard** (within 1-2 seconds):
- ✅ Student "BDS2024001" status changes: Pending → **In** (green chip)
- ✅ Last Updated shows current time
- ✅ Hall name appears under timestamp
- ✅ Statistics update: Present=1, Pending=12

### 7. Test EXIT Event

```powershell
# Generate EXIT event for same student
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/camera/test-events" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"eventType":"EXIT_ONLY","studentId":"BDS2024001"}'
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Student status changes: In → **Out** (blue chip)
- ✅ Timestamp updates
- ✅ Statistics update accordingly

### 8. Test Class Switching

1. Change **Program** to "MBBS"
2. Change **Year** to "2"
3. Click **"Load Class"**

**Expected**:
- ✅ Student list clears and reloads with MBBS Year 2 students
- ✅ All students reset to "Pending"
- ✅ Session info updates (if MBBS Year 2 has current session)
- ✅ Statistics reset to new class counts

### 9. Test Event Filtering

With **MBBS Year 2** loaded, generate event for **BDS Year 1**:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/camera/test-events" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"eventType":"ENTRY_ONLY","studentId":"BDS2024001"}'
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Dashboard does NOT update (event ignored because it's for different class)
- ✅ Only events matching selected class appear

## 🎯 Testing Matrix

| Test | Command | Expected Status Change |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| Load BDS-1 | Click "Load Class" | All → Pending |
| Entry Event | `ENTRY_ONLY` for BDS2024001 | Pending → In |
| Exit Event | `EXIT_ONLY` for BDS2024001 | In → Out |
| Load MBBS-2 | Change dropdown + Load | All → Pending (new list) |
| Wrong Class Event | `ENTRY_ONLY` for BDS2024001 while MBBS-2 selected | No change (filtered) |
| Wait 10 mins | (After session start) | Pending → Absent |

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

### Visual Elements:
- ✅ Connection status shows "Connected" (green wifi icon)
- ✅ Class selection dropdowns functional
- ✅ Session card has gradient purple background
- ✅ Statistics cards have colored top borders (blue/green/red/orange)
- ✅ Status chips color-coded:
  - Gray = Pending
  - Green = In
  - Blue = Out
  - Red = Absent

### Functionality:
- ✅ Students load on class selection
- ✅ Real-time events update specific student status
- ✅ Events filtered by selected class only
- ✅ Statistics update automatically
- ✅ Timestamps show in readable format (HH:MM AM/PM)
- ✅ Session info displays correctly
- ✅ Empty state shows when no class selected

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No students loaded"
```powershell
# Seed database
cd c:\Attendance\MGC\backend
npm run seed
```

### Issue: "No active session found"
```powershell
# Seed timetable
cd c:\Attendance\MGC\backend
npm run seed:timetable
```

### Issue: "Events not updating"
**Check**:
1. Connection status (should be green "Connected")
2. Browser console for Socket.IO errors
3. StudentId in event matches loaded students
4. Event program/year matches selected class

### Issue: "Compilation errors"
```powershell
# Rebuild frontend
cd c:\Attendance\MGC\frontend
npm install
ng serve
```

## 📊 Sample Student IDs for Testing

### BDS Students:
- BDS2024001, BDS2024002, ..., BDS2024013

### MBBS Students:
- MBBS2024001, MBBS2024002, ..., MBBS2024010

### B.Sc Nursing Students:
- BSN2024001, BSN2024002, ..., BSN2024010

## 🎨 Status Chip Colors

| Status | Color | Icon | Meaning |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| Pending | Gray | schedule | Waiting for student to enter |
| In | Green | login | Student entered hall |
| Out | Blue | logout | Student exited hall |
| Absent | Red | cancel | Not present after 10 minutes |

## 📝 API Testing with cURL

### Get Students:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/students?programName=BDS&year=1&section=A&limit=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Get Current Session:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/timetable/current?programName=BDS&year=1&section=A" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Generate Test Event:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/camera/test-events" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"eventType":"ENTRY_ONLY","studentId":"BDS2024001"}'
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your implementation is working correctly if:
1. ✅ You can select a class and see all students
2. ✅ Student status updates in real-time when events occur
3. ✅ Only events for selected class appear
4. ✅ Statistics update automatically
5. ✅ Session info displays for current class
6. ✅ Status chips are color-coded correctly
7. ✅ Switching classes loads new student list
