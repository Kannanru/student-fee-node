## 🧪 Testing

### How to Test

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Frontend:**
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   ng serve
   ```

3. **Navigate to Fee Collection:**
   - Login as admin
   - Go to `/fees/fee-collection`

4. **Test Flow:**
   - Search and select a student
   - Verify fee status summary displays
   - Check fee heads table (only unpaid heads)
   - Select fee heads with checkboxes
   - Verify total updates automatically
   - Choose payment mode
   - Fill required fields (if any)
   - Submit payment
   - Re-select same student
   - Verify paid heads no longer appear

### Expected Behavior

| Action | Expected Result |
|--------|----------------|
| Select student | Fee status loads, shows paid/remaining breakdown |
| Check fee head | Total increases by fee head amount |
| Uncheck fee head | Total decreases by fee head amount |
| Click "Select All" | All fee heads selected, total = sum of all |
| Click "Clear All" | All fee heads deselected, total = 0 |
| Choose Cash mode | No additional fields required |
| Choose UPI mode | Transaction ID field appears (required) |
| Choose Bank Transfer | Bank Name + Transaction ID appear (required) |
| Choose Cheque mode | Cheque #, Date, Bank Name appear (required) |

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. Smart Fee Head Display
- ✅ **Before Payment:** Student has 15 fee heads
- ✅ **After Paying 10:** Only 5 unpaid heads shown
- ✅ **After Paying All:** "All Fees Paid!" message

### 2. Real-time Total Calculation
```typescript
totalAmount = computed(() => {
  const feeStatus = this.studentFeeStatus();
  const selected = this.selectedFeeHeads();
  let total = 0;
  feeStatus.remainingFeeHeads.forEach(head => {
    if (selected.has(head._id)) {
      total += head.amount;
    }
  });
  return total;
});
```

### 3. Payment History Tracking
```javascript
// Backend logic
const payments = await Payment.find({ studentId });
const paidFeeHeadIds = new Set();
payments.forEach(payment => {
  payment.headsPaid.forEach(head => {
    paidFeeHeadIds.add(head.headId.toString());
  });
});
```

### 4. Conditional Field Validation
```typescript
// Frontend validation
switch (paymentMode) {
  case 'online':
  case 'bank_transfer':
    this.setValidators(['transactionId']);
    break;
  case 'cheque':
  case 'dd':
    this.setValidators(['bankName', 'chequeNumber', 'chequeDate']);
    break;
}
```

  studentId: ObjectId("..."),
  studentName: "John Doe",
  amount: 15000,  // Total of all selected fee heads
  paymentMode: "cash",
  headsPaid: [  // NEW: Array of paid fee heads
    {
      headId: ObjectId("..."),
      headCode: "TF001",
      headName: "Tuition Fee",
      amount: 10000
    },
    {
      headId: ObjectId("..."),
      headCode: "LF001",

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Signals vs Observables
- Used **signals** for local state (selectedStudent, selectedFeeHeads)
- Used **observables** for HTTP requests
- **Computed signals** for derived values (totalAmount)

### Why Set for selectedFeeHeads?
```typescript
selectedFeeHeads = signal<Set<string>>(new Set());
// Set provides O(1) lookup for has(), add(), delete()
// Perfect for checkbox selection tracking
```

### Payment Mode Mapping
```
Frontend         Backend Payment Model
'cash'       →   'cash'
'upi'        →   'upi' (with upiDetails)
'bank_transfer' → 'bank-transfer' (with bankTransferDetails)
'cheque'     →   'cheque' (with chequeDetails)
'dd'         →   'dd' (with ddDetails)
'online'     →   'online' (with onlinePaymentDetails)
```
