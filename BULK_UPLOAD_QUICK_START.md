- Wait for processing

### 5. Review Results
- View summary: Total, Successful, Failed, Already Paid
- Check detailed table for each row
- Export results to CSV if needed

## Testing the Feature

### Test with Sample Data

1. **Generate Sample Excel File**:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/generate_sample_excel.js
```
This creates: `backend/public/templates/sample_fee_upload.xlsx`

2. **Use Existing Students**:
The system already has students like:
- Siva Priyan (STU001234) - Semester 2
- Anika Yadav (BDS000030) - Semester 1
- And more from seeding

3. **Test Upload**:
- Use the generated sample file
- Or create your own with existing student IDs
- Upload and see results!

## What Happens During Upload

1. **File Validation**
   - Checks file type (.xlsx or .xls)
   - Validates file size (max 5MB)
   - Parses Excel data

2. **Row Processing**
   For each row:
   - Validates required fields
   - Finds student by ID
   - Matches fee plan (program + year + quota)
   - Creates student bill
   - If "Paid": Creates payment and marks all fees as paid

3. **Result Generation**
   - Shows success/failure for each row
   - Provides detailed error messages
   - Displays bill and receipt numbers

## Example Results

### Successful Upload
```
Row | Student ID | Year | Status      | Message                     | Bill Number    | Receipt Number
----|------------|------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------
2   | BDS000030  | 1    | Success     | Successfully marked as paid| BILL-2025-00124| RCP-2025-00125
3   | STU001234  | 2    | Success     | Bill created as pending    | BILL-2025-00125| â€”
4   | INVALID123 | 1    | Failed      | Student not found          | â€”              | â€”
```

### Summary Stats
- **Total Rows**: 7
- **Successful**: 5
- **Failed**: 2
- **Already Paid**: 1
- **Invalid**: 0

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mark Multiple Students as Paid
```excel
Student ID    | Fee Year | Payment Status
BDS000030     | 1        | Paid
STU001234     | 1        | Paid
EN2024BDS030  | 1        | Paid
```
Result: Creates bills and payments for all 3 students

### Scenario 2: Create Pending Bills
```excel
Student ID    | Fee Year | Payment Status
BDS000031     | 2        | Not Paid
STU001235     | 2        | Not Paid
```
Result: Creates bills without payments (pending status)

### Scenario 3: Mixed Status
```excel
Student ID    | Fee Year | Payment Status
BDS000030     | 1        | Paid
BDS000031     | 1        | Not Paid
BDS000032     | 1        | Paid
```
Result: Mix of paid and pending bills

## Troubleshooting

### "Student not found"
- **Cause**: Student ID doesn't exist in database
- **Solution**: Verify student ID matches exactly (check Students list)

### "No fee plan found"
- **Cause**: No fee structure for that program/year/quota
- **Solution**: Create fee plan in Fee Structure management

### "Already marked as paid"
- **Cause**: Bill already exists and is paid
- **Solution**: This is informational, no action needed

### "Validation errors"
- **Cause**: Missing or invalid data in Excel
- **Solution**: Check required columns are filled correctly
