## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a waiter in a restaurant. Imagine you are at a restaurant, and you want to order food. You tell the waiter what you want, and the waiter brings it to you. Similarly, an API allows two programs to talk to each other. For example, when you log in to a website, the website talks to the server using an API to check if your username and password are correct.
