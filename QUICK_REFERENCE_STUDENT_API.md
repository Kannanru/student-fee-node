# Student API Integration - Quick Reference

## ✅ STATUS: COMPLETE

All student CRUD operations are now integrated with backend APIs.

## 🔧 Changes Made

1. **Environment**: Set `useMockData: false` in `environment.ts`
2. **Student Service**: Added response normalization for all CRUD ops
3. **Error Handling**: Enhanced to show backend validation errors
4. **Fixed**: MockStudentService method call compilation error

## 📡 Endpoints Integrated

- ✅ GET `/api/students` - List (with search, filters, pagination)
- ✅ GET `/api/students/profile/:id` - Get by ID
- ✅ POST `/api/students` - Create
- ✅ PUT `/api/students/:id` - Update
- ✅ DELETE `/api/students/:id` - Delete

## 🧪 Quick Test

```
1. Login: http://localhost:5000/admin_login_test.html
   Email: thilak.askan@gmail.com
   Password: Askan@123

2. Navigate: http://localhost:4200/students

3. Test:
   ✅ List loads from MongoDB
   ✅ Search & filter work

```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Section**: Required field - options: A, B, C, D
- **Roll Number**: Required field - text input
- **JWT Token**: Stored as 'authToken' in localStorage
- **Backend**: Must be running on port 5000
- **Frontend**: Must be running on port 4200

## 🐛 Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Login again to refresh JWT token |
