✅ GET    /api/quota-configs/active      - Get active quotas
✅ GET    /api/fee-plans                 - Get all structures
✅ GET    /api/fee-plans/:id             - Get single structure
✅ POST   /api/fee-plans                 - Create structure
✅ PUT    /api/fee-plans/:id             - Update structure
✅ DELETE /api/fee-plans/:id             - Delete structure
✅ POST   /api/fee-plans/:id/clone       - Clone structure
✅ PATCH  /api/fee-plans/:id/status      - Toggle active status
```

## 🔧 Temporary Solution (Until Node.js Updated)

Since you can't run Angular yet, use the test page I created:
```
http://localhost:5000/fee-structure-manager.html
```

This provides the same functionality in plain HTML/JavaScript.

---

## 📊 Database Ready

You already have:
- ✅ **13 active fee heads** (Tuition, Library, Lab, Hostel, etc.)
- ✅ **4 active quotas** (Puducherry UT, All India, NRI, Self-Sustaining)
- ✅ **Backend running** on port 5000
- ✅ **MongoDB connected**

---

## 💡 Key Advantage of Your Angular Components

Compared to the test page, your Angular components have:

1. **Better UX**:
   - Material Design
   - Smooth animations
   - Responsive layout
   - Professional look

2. **More Features**:
   - Sorting

   - Consistent theme
   - Role-based access

4. **Maintainable**:
   - TypeScript type safety
   - Component-based architecture
   - Reusable code
   - Easy to extend
