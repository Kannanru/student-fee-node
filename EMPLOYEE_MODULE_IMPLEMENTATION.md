   - status
   - firstName + lastName (compound)

2. **Lazy Loading:**
   - Employee form component loaded only when needed
   - Employee detail component loaded only when needed

3. **Search Debouncing:**
   - 300ms delay prevents excessive API calls

4. **Pagination:**
   - Default 20 items per page
   - Reduces data transfer and render time

5. **Component Cleanup:**
   - Proper unsubscribe with takeUntil
