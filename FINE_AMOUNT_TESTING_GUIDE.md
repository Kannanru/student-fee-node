## Database Verification

```

**Verify:**
```json
{
  "dueDates": [
    {
      "installmentNumber": 1,
      "dueDate": ISODate("..."),
      "amount": 25000,
      "finePerDay": 10  // ‚úÖ Should be present
    }
  ]
}
```

### Check Payment Record in MongoDB
```bash
db.payments.find().sort({ createdAt: -1 }).limit(1)
```

**Verify:**
```json
{
  "amount": 25000,
  "fineAmount": 90,        // ‚úÖ Should be present
  "daysDelayed": 9,        // ‚úÖ Should be present
  "finePerDay": 10,        // ‚úÖ Should be present
  "totalAmountWithFine": 25090  // ‚úÖ Should be present
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Installment section not appearing
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `dueDatesArray` getter is defined
- Ensure `updateInstallments()` is called on form init

### Issue: Fine not calculating
**Solution**:
- Verify due date is in the past
- Check `calculateFineAmount()` method is called
- Verify `finePerDay` exists in fee structure

### Issue: Fine not showing in payment
**Solution**:
- Check browser network tab for API payload
- Verify `submitPayment()` includes fine fields
- Check backend controller accepts fine fields

### Issue: Form validation errors
**Solution**:
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Check `dueDatesArray.markAllAsTouched()` is called
- Verify validators are set correctly

---

## Browser Console Tests

### Test Fine Calculation Manually
```javascript
// In browser console on fee collection page
const today = new Date();
const dueDate = new Date('2025-01-15'); // Past date
const diffTime = today.getTime() - dueDate.getTime();
const daysDelayed = Math.floor(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
const finePerDay = 10;
const fineAmount = daysDelayed * finePerDay;
console.log(`Days Delayed: ${daysDelayed}, Fine: ‚Çπ${fineAmount}`);
```
