## 🔍 Integration Verification

### Data Flow Check

For each operation, verify:

| Frontend Action | API Endpoint | MongoDB Action | Result |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Load list | GET /students | Find all | ✅ Real-time data |
| Search "John" | GET /students?search=John | $regex query | ✅ Filtered results |
| Click "Active" tab | GET /students?status=active | Filter by status | ✅ Only active |
| Filter "BDS" | GET /students?programName=BDS | Filter by program | ✅ Only BDS |
| Combined filters | GET /students?search=...&status=...&program=... | Multiple filters | ✅ All criteria |
| View student | GET /students/profile/:id | FindById | ✅ Full details |
| Edit student | PUT /students/:id | UpdateOne | ✅ Changes saved |
| Delete student | DELETE /students/:id | DeleteOne | ✅ Removed |

---

## 📊 Performance Check

### API Response Times

Monitor in Network tab:

| Operation | Target Time | Acceptable Time |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| List students | < 300ms | < 500ms |
| Search | < 500ms | < 800ms |
| View student | < 200ms | < 300ms |
| Update student | < 300ms | < 500ms |
| Delete student | < 200ms | < 300ms |

**If slower**: Check MongoDB indexes, network latency

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Search Not Working

**Symptoms**: Typing in search box doesn't update results

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open DevTools → Console
2. Look for: `"Search triggered: [term]"`
3. Check Network tab for: `GET /students?search=[term]`
4. If no API call → Check if debounce is working
5. If API call fails → Check backend logs

**Common Fixes**:
- Clear browser cache
- Verify backend is running
- Check JWT token is valid

---

### Issue: Tabs Not Filtering

**Symptoms**: Clicking tabs doesn't change results

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open Console, look for: `"Tab changed: [status]"`
2. Check Network tab for: `GET /students?status=[status]`
3. If no API call → Check onTabChange() method
4. If API call but no results → Check MongoDB data

**Common Fixes**:
- Verify students with that status exist in DB
- Check status field values (lowercase: "active" not "Active")

---

### Issue: Filters Not Combining

**Symptoms**: Multiple filters don't work together

**Debug Steps**:
1. Console should show all filters: `{search: "...", status: "...", programName: "..."}`
2. Network should show: `GET /students?search=...&status=...&programName=...`
3. If missing parameters → Check loadStudents() method

**Fix**: Already implemented - all filters sent together

---

### Issue: Edit Not Loading Data

**Symptoms**: Edit form is empty

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check Network for: `GET /students/profile/:id`
2. Verify :id is correct in URL
3. Check response contains student data
4. Check console for errors

**Common Fixes**:
- Verify student ID in route params
- Check API returns success: true
- Ensure populateForm() is called

---

### Issue: Delete Not Working

**Symptoms**: Delete button doesn't remove student

**Debug Steps**:
1. Click Delete → Check for confirmation dialog
2. Confirm → Check Network for: `DELETE /students/:id`
3. Check response: `{success: true}`
4. If API succeeds but list doesn't update → Check loadStudents() is called

**Common Fixes**:
- Verify JWT token in Authorization header
- Check backend has permission to delete
- Ensure redirect to list after delete
