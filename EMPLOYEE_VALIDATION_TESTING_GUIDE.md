## 📊 Database Verification

### MongoDB Checks

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB
mongo
use mgdc_fees

// 1. Check employee created
db.employees.findOne({ employeeId: "EMP001" })

// 2. Verify no salary field exists
db.employees.findOne({ employeeId: "EMP001" }, { salary: 1 })
// Should return: { "_id": ..., "salary": undefined }

// 3. Check unique constraints
db.employees.createIndex({ employeeId: 1 }, { unique: true })
db.employees.createIndex({ email: 1 }, { unique: true })

// 4. Verify all employees
db.employees.find({}, { firstName: 1, lastName: 1, employeeId: 1, department: 1 })

// 5. Count by department
db.employees.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$department", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])

// 6. Count by category
db.employees.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$category", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])

// 7. Find employees with incomplete data
db.employees.find({ 
  $or: [
    { "address.street": { $exists: false } },
    { "emergencyContact.name": { $exists: false } }
  ]
