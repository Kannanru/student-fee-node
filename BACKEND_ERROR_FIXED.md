# Backend Error Fixed ✅

## Issue
```
ReferenceError: Student is not defined
at exports.getStudentFeeStructures
```

## Root Cause
The new controller methods (`getStudentFeeStructures` and `getFeeHeadsWithPaymentStatus`) were using `Student`, `FeePlan`, `Payment`, and `Invoice` models directly, but these were not imported at the top of the file.

## Solution
Added missing imports to `backend/controllers/studentController.js`:

```javascript
const Student = require('../models/Student');
const FeePlan = require('../models/FeePlan');
const Payment = require('../models/Payment');
const Invoice = require('../models/Invoice');
```

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Backend controller now has all required imports

## Next Steps
1. Restart your backend server (if needed):
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Attendance\MGC\backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test the fee collection flow:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:4200/fees/collection
   - Select a student
   - Verify fee structures load without errors

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ No more "Student is not defined" error
- ✅ API endpoint `/api/students/:id/fee-structures` works
- ✅ API endpoint `/api/students/:id/fee-structures/:structureId/heads` works
- ✅ Fee collection workflow completes successfully
